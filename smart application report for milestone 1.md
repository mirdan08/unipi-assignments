# first milestone report
Our group is composed of only two people Mirko Michele D'angelo and Riccardo Marcaccio, so we decided to split the workload according to our previous knowledge and skills:
- given Riccardo's knowledge of expression parsing and testing he took care of developing and testing the calculation engine.
- Mirko got the role of the topic leader and took care of defining the general structure and logic of the KPI engine along with the sota analysis.
# milestone's deliverables
For this milestone our main deliverables where:
- a sota analysis to narrow down the technologies to use to interact with the database and do the necessary calculations in the engine
- a first definition of the calculation logic 
- a first implementation of the semantical validation aspect of the engine
- a first implementation of the the bare calculation logic
## workflow
Given the small number of people in the group organization was done mainly through calls on a need basis, for topic meetings, and scheduled group calls with other topics when interactions were necessary.
