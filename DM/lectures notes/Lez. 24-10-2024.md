bascailly features do not have a an orrer thus having {A,B,C,D} meas having all possible transactional possibilities.

The rule based approach works with few records however it is difficult for numerical vales a nice idea would be discretization of such values to be able to apply it.

We havve try to make a pair with a air where we get sets where each ite mis combination of the name of the column and the values thus we gain context.


Verry cool technique but yields a high dimensional dataset.

to mitigate such problems we could do "discretazion" and aggregate siilar things e.g. use a similarity function and/or knowledge you have.

example : if you have a bachelor and a phd you don't want aggregation.

TLDR: if you don't have ....

we could have multilevel hierarchical association rules, you can categorize levels of knowledge the products.

## the apriori algorithm

we have the frequent k items eet and candidate k-itemsets,
