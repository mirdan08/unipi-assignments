We should have a way to understand if my prediction is reliable e.g. financial applications, we need to have someone responsible. We have a confidence value that tells me the attendability of certain predictions

When the probability to be correct when my confidence to be correct is equal to the probability to be correct.


The confidence in the network is given by giving a wrong estimate basically from backpropagation giving too much weight to the wrong neurons.

Two ways of making inference:
- online: answer as soon as data arrives
- batch:asynchronous prediction
