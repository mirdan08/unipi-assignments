What we want first is a formal definition, the first important part is quantification which can be summarized to mapping human observations into numbers and the results of a _quantification_ is a _measure_ and from measure derive _metric_ i.e. we use measures to calculate a value that tells us something useful about our business e.g. “investments in the marketing” and “the number of customers acquired” to calculate **a total cost to gain a new customer.**
## definition

- Indicator: it shows a number
- Performance: it is a metric bu is also connected to business performance.

An indicator is a numerical values linked to some process/business objective and tells use the performance of said process.
A scorecard is a set of indicators grouped according to rules:
- indicators are normalized w.r.t. their properties and represented in a hierarchical structure to contribute to the performance of their container. The contribution is weighted by its relevance for their container.
