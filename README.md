# unipi assignments
Repository i use to store the assignments i do @Unipisa 

## repo outline
For now only the assignments for Intelligent Systems for Pattern Recognition, Continual Learning and SPM courses are available.
### ISPR
The assignments are 3:
- An analysis on a time series regarding air quality data using cross-correlation.
- An implementation of a Restricted Bolzmann Machine with the CD-1 algorithm to learn and reconstruct digits from the MNIST dataset.
- An experiment done using three types of Autoencoders still on the MNIST dataset, this time i also used the gradient ascent algorithm to generate numbers starting from gaussian noise and test their dimension reduction capabilities.
### CL
A series of exercises to try some of the concepts learned from the Continual Learning.
### SPM
This folder contains the assignments done for the Parallel & distributed systems course:
- implementation of the softmax function using AVX and autovectorization.
- implementation of static and dynamic shceduling strategy to find the maximum collatz steps for a set of rages of values.
- implementation of a parallel compression/decompression algorithm using OMP and miniz.
- implementation of a parallel and distributed version of the mergesort algorithm using FastFlow an MPI(works but misses the README.md file and was not delivered).
