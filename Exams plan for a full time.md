This is the plan i have for a full time position for my current situation. Just skip to the conclusions if you don't care about considerations or exams modalities.
## exams situation

Note : each lesson is 2h + further study  and possibly exercises/project and/or report to do on the side to complete an exam.

exams to do:
- 3 x 6 CFUs with 24 lessons
- 3 x 9 CFUs with 36 lessons

mandatory exams:
- SPM (9 CFU): theory + project(cannot be flexible since i have to share a machine with other students to do the project thus heavy variance in the time it takes to do the project, also it is possible to do 4 assignments at home to avoid the projects but the teacher is not clear about how much the weight plus he changes idea on them during lessons so it is better to avoid them entirely.
- CM (9 CFU): theory + project, it's flexible in the sense that there is not date but it is in teams of two so i have to coordinate with another person. Plus the project is very time consuming since i have to wait the teachers responses before continuing the project. Note: the projects changes next year so not finishing it means starting from scratch, it is possible to a project by myself but it also means double the work. I already picked a project with another person.

planned facultative exams(i have to do them but i can choose 3 from 6 CFUs and 1 from 9 CFUs):
- SDC (9CFU) theory + project / presentation, all lessons are recorded so i can attend them when i want and do it in the summer.
- IR (6CFU) theory + project + written exam (w. exercises) : everything is recorded so i can do the same as above but it is demanding given the exam structure.
- ROBOTICS (6CFU) theory + project : lessons are recorded  so i don't have to be there in person but i have to coordinate with a tutor for the project.
- CHL (6CFU) : very few lessons then you only work on the project but it is very aleatory since you have to get good teammates plus you have to collaborate with another company and it could be difficult to communicate.
- CL (6CFU) : lessons are not registered and it can be very demanding , i already attended some lessons but it could be better to do another exam since i could waste time.
- CMCS (6CFU) : lessons completely registered, the exam modality is just a paper presentation so i could keep it as  a last resort if things go bad and i have less time.

Thesis: it can be very time consuming however with the internal thesis i could shorten times by a lot, it is to be evaluated in the future.
## Available hours
for a full time job you have to do 8h a day for 5 days a week:
- 2 days in presence : you cannot study during the day given travel time, at most two hours after dinner.
- 3 days at home : you can study more so take into account 3.5 hours on a realistic scale
you have 2 days remaining so if count that you have to rest at least once and hang out to avoid too much stress/burnout you have to remove 2 study hours from friday after dinner and a morning from saturday to rest , in short you have 8 hours saturday and 10-12 hours on sunday.

so it is $2 * 2h + 3 * 3.5h + (8 + 10) h = 32,5 h$ per week. In a month it is roughly 130h to study.

i have 150 hours of permit study but i don't know how much i could use them given the responsability i would have on the job,i could but it has to make sense with the necessities of the project i would have to work on.
## Considerations
keep into account that just attending/watching a lesson is not enough and projects can be difficult to make or very time consuming, so ideally i could cover 7 lessons a week meaning that a 6CFU exam takes 3,5 weeks to do all the lessons plus the projects/exercises when needed and you cannot do the exams when you want to do so take into account that in a session you can do at most 3 exams in summer and 2 during winter plus thesis that you have to do after.

If CM goes well i could go down to "just" 5 exams if i manage to do it before the summer which is very unlikely, it depends on the other person plus other exams and difficulty of the project which is difficult to estimate.

In a very optimistic view i could be able to complete all the exams in early 2026 thus i should be able to graduate in summer 2026 at most october however most exams can be difficult to deal with and maybe 2027 is more accurate even with the internal thesis it could be summer 2027.

For the exams in summer i intend to do SDC and SPM in the 2025 summer session and also CM depending on how the project goes or a 6 CFU exam depending on which one im able to do(this also means september). If work at least 6 months i can get extraordinary sessions as a worker student so another exam could be done on november but it heavily depends on how the summer session goes and what exams are remaining to do.
## Conclusions
So a full time job means 2 years more (at least realistically speaking) of time to complete a master degree if i don't care about grades. Note that 1/2 exams are in groups so i cannot take a lot of decisions on timings for these. This also assumes that there is no overtime and i don't take more responsibilities or time consuming activities for the job outside coding in the office/from home. Also take into account that some exam modalities might have sudden  changes but i can find that out only when lessons will start in february.

All in all to make this feasible i have to take into consideration if there are further resposabilities and how i could manage a career of this kind while studying and also make career progression could be problematic depending on the additional duties required to do so while studying for a demaning master's degree like AI.
