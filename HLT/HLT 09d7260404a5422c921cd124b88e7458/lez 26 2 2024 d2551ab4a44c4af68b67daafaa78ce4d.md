# edit distance

the TTR is useful for to analyzes the lexical richness of the vocabulary

the segmenter in BPE applies the rules obtained fro the laerning phase , it does so greddily and in the order we found them, lemmatizaton associate a word to a token while stemming is made to cut word and improve the recall but the meaning of the words is not retained

## minimum edit distance

we measure how similar two strings are, this algoirhtm is useful  the mae clusters of words

it measures the minimum number of edit operations to get from a string to another, the operations are:

- insertion
- deletion
- substitution

each operation has cost 1 but substitution costs 2 

in thi case we have parallel corpora , a sentence in a langauge and another in another language

we first count the lexical overlapping between the first sentence and the second one , from the operations done we can also infer some relationship between words.

of couse the space  of all possible edits is huge so the solution is to esploit dynamic programming, we calculate the solution for a small part and the we use the already computed values later to avoidd recomputation
